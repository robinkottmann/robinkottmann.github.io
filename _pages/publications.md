    <summary>Abstract</summary>
   We study the effects of retirement on cognitive functioning among women aged 63 to 67 by exploiting a German retirement reform that raised the early retirement age for women born after 1951 by three years, from 60 to 63. Our indicators of cognitive functioning are experimental measures (word recall, semantic fluency, and the Stroop test) from a large biomedical data set, as well as the diagnosis of cognitive disorders from administrative health insurance claims. We find reductions of around 12% of a standard deviation per year in retirement for measures of fluid intelligence and of an insignificant 6% for crystallized intelligence. The diagnosis of cognitive disorders remains unaffected.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Does exposure to air pollution impact mental health? This paper uses administrative health insurance data to estimate the medium-term cumulative effects of air pollution exposure on mental health outcomes. For identification, we exploit the staggered introduction of Low Emission Zones (LEZs) across German cities, which restrict access for emission-intensive vehicles. We find that LEZs reduce various air pollutants and improve the population's mental health measured by depression and anxiety diagnoses, prescriptions, and specialist visits. The health benefits emerge gradually, with younger individuals benefiting the most. Our findings suggest substantial mental health co-benefits and avoided health costs from improved air quality.
